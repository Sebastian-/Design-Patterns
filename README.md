# Design Patterns

My notes on design patterns and their implementation.

## General Themes

* Separate programs into parts that vary and parts that do not.
    * Generally, a program will need to change it's behavior based on it's input data, while the overarching process remains the same for that class of data. For instance, calculating employee wages will vary based on each employee's contract, but the same general process should apply. If the variations among employees can be encapsulated, the core payroll program will not have to change as often.
